###

This package is an implementation of Ulam's method [[1]](#1), [[2]](#2) (see also Galerkin projection [[3]](#3)) for the discretization of a stochastic operator. Given a set of two-dimensional, one-step trajectories $(x_{0, 1}, y_{0, 1}) \to  (x_{T, 1}, y_{T, 1}), (x_{0, 2}, y_{0, 2}) \to  (x_{T, 2}, y_{T, 2}) \dots$ defined in a rectangular domain, the following steps are performed

- A covering of the the domain is generated by polygons according to several different algorithms.
- Bin the data according to the covering to generate a transition probability matrix such that any data outside the computational domain is lumped into a so-called "nirvana" state [[4]](#4).
- Transition path theory statistics [[5]](#5) are computed on the stationary, time-homogenous Markov chain induced by the transition probability matrix.



Generate a transition probability matrix from two-dimensional trajectory data. The data can be binned according to several different algorithms.
