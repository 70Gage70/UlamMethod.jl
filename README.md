# UlamMethod.jl

This package is an implementation of Ulam's method for the discretization of a stochastic operator using pure Julia. Given a set of two-dimensional, one-step trajectories defined in a domain, the essential goal of Ulam's method is to partition the domain into a series of non-intersecting boxes and construct a transition probability matrix on these boxes. Refer to the documentation for installation, quickstart, examples and API reference.
