# High level overview

Use of this package proceeds as follows.

1. Create `Trajectories` using your trajectory data
2. Select the computational domain (`Boundary`). Data inside the boundary are considered "interior" and data outside the boundary are considered "exterior" or "in nirvana"[^1] [^2]. Use the `AutoBoundary` function to attempt to select a reasonable boundary automatically. In 2D, the `AutoBoundary2D` function is also available, which may find a tighter boundary than `AutoBoundary`.
3. Select a `BinningAlgorithm` and set any parameters it has.
4. Optionally, select a `ReinjectionAlgorithm` to handle the behavior of trajectories points from nirvana to the interior.
5. Run `ulam_method(traj, binner; reinj_algo)`.
6. Inspect and process the result with `P_closed`, `bins`, `membership` and other functions.
7. Visualize the result with `viz` and `viz!`.

[^2]: In brief, nirvana is an extra state appended to an open system to close it; trajectories which point from inside the domain to the outisde of the domain transition to this nirvana state. Trajectories which point from outside the domain to the inside are transitions "from" nirvana - how exactly these data are reinjected is controlled by the `ReinjectionAlgorithm`.
